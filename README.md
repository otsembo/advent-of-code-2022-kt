# ADVENT OF CODE 2022
Advent of code 2022 is here. Time to flex my brain muscles as I attempt to complete challenges for this year.

## Description
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
